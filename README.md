## Setup Instructions

### Flask Server Setup

1. Navigate to the flask-server directory:

   ```bash
   cd flask-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

5. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Flutter App Setup

1. Install Flutter dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Important Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Keep your API keys secure

# Vitron

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/737a68b7-d57e-455b-bead-392e6748a1ca

I have created an application that allows users to input their medical routines in an unorganized paragraph format. Once the user submits the text by clicking a button, the application processes the input and generates an organized image of the medical routine in PNG format. If the user is signed up or signed in, this image is saved in their history. Users also have the option to share the image via a link that can be easily copied from the app. For users who are not signed in, the image will be automatically deleted by a cron job after 24 hours.

# Workflow

The user enters their unorganized medical routine, which is sent to the Gemini API to generate HTML code for an organized version of the routine. Once the server receives this HTML code, it is stored in an HTML file. This file is then opened in a Selenium browser, where a screenshot is taken and saved in the static folder. The filename of the saved image is sent back to the application, which displays the image and stores it in the userâ€™s history if they are signed in. Users can share the image through a link generated by the app. If the user is not signed in, the image will be deleted by the cron job after 24 hours.

# Installation

Here's a detailed installation README for setting up your project with Flutter, MongoDB, and a Flask server. This includes the necessary steps to configure the database and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Flutter**: [Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Python**: [Download and Install](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **MongoDB**: [Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
- **Node.js** (if using any Node packages for Flutter)

## Setting Up MongoDB

1. **Install MongoDB**: Follow the instructions in the MongoDB installation guide above to set up MongoDB on your machine.

2. **Start MongoDB Service**:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

3. **Create Database and Collections**:
   - Open a new terminal and enter the MongoDB shell:
     ```bash
     mongo
     ```
   - Create the database named "vitron":
     ```javascript
     use vitron
     ```
   - Create the collections "users" and "history":
     ```javascript
     db.createCollection("users");
     db.createCollection("history");
     ```

## Setting Up Flask Server

1. **Navigate to Flask Server Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd flask-server
   ```

2. **Install Required Python Packages**:
   Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the `flask-server` directory. If not, create one with the necessary libraries. Example:

   ```
   Flask==2.0.1
   pymongo==3.11.4
   schedule==1.1.0
   ```

   Install the requirements:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add ChromeDriver**:

   - Download the appropriate ChromeDriver for your Chrome version from [ChromeDriver Downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
   - Place the `chromedriver` executable in the `flask-server` directory.

4. **Run the Flask App**:
   Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Set Up Cron Job**:
   If you want to run `cron.py` as a cron job, edit your crontab:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add the following line to schedule `cron.py` (replace with your preferred schedule):
   ```
   * * * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/flask-server/cron.py
   ```

## Modifications

1. **Replace Gemini API**:
   Open `app.py` and navigate to line 10. Replace the existing Gemini API code with your own API.

2. **Change Variables in Dart**:
   Open `lib/variables.dart` in your Flutter project and update the variables according to your requirements.

## Running Flutter App

1. **Navigate to Flutter Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/flutter/project
   ```

2. **Run Flutter App**:
   Use the following command to run your Flutter application:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up the development environment for your project with Flutter, MongoDB, and Flask. Ensure your MongoDB service is running and your Flask server is started before running the Flutter app.

For any issues or queries, feel free to refer to the documentation of the respective technologies or ask for help!
